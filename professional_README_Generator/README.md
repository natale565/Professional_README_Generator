# Professional README Generator

## Description
- This application was created using node.js to generate professional README.md docs from the command line to cut down on the amount of time developers are using to write their README.md files. 

- By the using the node.js package, inquirer, this application takes the user through a series of prompts regarding the application.

- Prompts include: title of application, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, what type of license is being used, as well as GitHub handle, and primary email.

- Once all prompts are answered, the application generates a professional README.md markdown file with the users inputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo: git clone

2. Open in VS Code.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. Follow the directions using this link.

4. Once node.js is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer.

6. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.

## Usage

After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node inex.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file under the ‘dist’ folder called ‘generatedREADME’. It’s generated in mark down syntax so you can copy and paste that code into your project!
